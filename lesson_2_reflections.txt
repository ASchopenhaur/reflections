What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?  A system git file is created and git creates a repository structure with the files already in the directory.  This is a necessary first step before actually commencing version control through commit commands.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?  The staging area holds those new files from the working directory that will soon be added to the version control repository.  The staging area helps a developer keep track of each file that will be part of the next commit.  Without a staging area, the developer would be forced to browse through a directory and depend on memory to know which files are included in the next commit.
